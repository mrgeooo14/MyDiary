        <h1>What is a Diary?</h1>
        <p>Many people keep diaries every day, 
            So it’s fast, easy, and fun to keep a private online diary through a website such as this one.
            The diary is a blank slate, ready for the owner to write whatever he or she feels.</p>
        <p>In fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_autobiographies_by_presidents_of_the_United_States"target="_blank">famous politicians</a> 
            through history were known to keep private thoughts in notebooks. 
            If diaries did not exist, some of the country's best wisdom could have been lost. 
            Diaries are valuable views into the past, and they reveal thoughts that may have died with the author, if a daily diary had not been kept.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, diaries have been kept in paper journals, written in pen, pencil, crayon, or whatever medium desired by the writer. 
            Recently, diaries have been converted to electronic form, such as blogs or online journals.</p>

        <h1>Why write a Diary?</h1>
        <p>Writing a diary is <a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/blogs/topics/live-well/2018/07/5-powerful-health-benefits-of-journaling"target="_blank">good for the mind</a>
            , and it helps reduce stress, as it brings out the day's worries. 
            Getting thoughts out on paper helps people stay organized, keeps goals on track, and pulls the day's worries into the open. 
            Writing is proven to be therapeutic, and many therapists suggest keeping a diary for their patients who need extra help in communications. 
            Also, your writing ability will improve.</p>
